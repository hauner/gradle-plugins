## jarTest Plugin

Create a jar *artifact* from the test build output of a project. It can be added as dependency via the *'testArchives'* configuration (which will also provide the transitive dependencies).

See [jarTest Plugin](https://github.com/hauner/gradle-plugins/tree/master/jartest) for usage info.

Gradle has a similar built-in feature via the [java-test-fixtures plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/java_testing.html#sec:java_test_fixtures).

## jarTest Demo

This a simple demo project for the **jarTest** plugin.
